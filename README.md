# Events Form

[Visit Here!](https://events-form.vercel.app/)

Create a UI for adding, deleting and updating content on a webpage.

## Description
The user will be asked to login and after credentials are verified the user will have access to the form. The form consists of two pages: Add and Edit. The add page allows for a new event to be added to the website whereas the edit page allows for the user to select an existing event and update it or delete it.

I chose to work with these technologies because I have am using them in another project, run-gslsamp website. Using it made getting started much easier and with the countless resources online it made debugging and learning api much easier than reading confusing documentation.

### Challenges
The biggest challenge was getting the api to work. It wasn't something I had in my toolbox before starting this project but knowing how important it was in the future was a great motivation. I still have some bugs to work on regarding the api but it can send data from the client to the database and query the database to post on the client.

### Future 
I plan to make a nav bar that will allow for a selection of several other forms pertaining to the website I am building. The main purpose of this is to nullify the need to go into source code inorder to make changes to the content of the website. Another feature that will be added is a preview of how the content will look prior to saving their content.

## How to use Project
